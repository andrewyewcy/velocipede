    "In the age of Big Data, it is unlikely that the required data is stored in a single MySQL database or within a single DBMS. As such, rather than using a tool specific to MySQL for data ingestion, Python was chosen as a generic tool to process raw data for data ingestion into the MySQL database. This avoids the need of using various GUIs to manage data ingestion into different DBMS, and also consolidates the process into a central location for easier maintenance and improvement. \n",
    "\n",
    "Below are some examples of where Python can be used for data ingestion:\n",
    "- **SQL Databases** using [`SQLAlchemy`](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/), a Python toolkit that allows data scientists to connect to many DBMS aside from MySQL such as PostgreSQL and SQLite, all within a single Python file.\n",
    "- **noSQL Databases** like `MongoDB`, `Redis` and `ScyllaDB`, which are tools more familiar to software developers. These do not need to follow the structured relational table format like SQL databases.\n",
    "- **serverless databases on cloud** like `Amazon Aurora`\n",
    "- **stream data** like that using `Apache Kafka`"
